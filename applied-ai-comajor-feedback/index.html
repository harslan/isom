            <p><strong>To:</strong> Chrisy Mavris</p>
            <p><strong>From:</strong> Hasan Arslan</p>
            <p><strong>Re:</strong> Jodi’s Applied AI Co-Major Proposal (Feb 13, 2026)</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <p>Chrisy, thank you for sharing this. I’ve read through both the main proposal and the Additional Details appendices carefully. Jodi has put together a thoughtful document with a solid market rationale, and I’m glad to see this kind of initiative moving forward. Below are my observations—organized into what I think works well, what raises questions, and some concrete suggestions for strengthening the proposal.</p>

        <h2>What Works Well</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The co-major model is smart.</strong> Mirroring the International Business structure—where students pair AI with any primary major—is an elegant design choice. It avoids the trap of creating yet another standalone tech program and instead positions AI as a cross-cutting capability, which is exactly how the market is moving.</li>
            <li><strong>The market analysis is compelling.</strong> The Lightcast data, WEF projections, and program growth statistics make a strong case. The 28% wage premium for AI skills and the fact that 51% of AI job postings are outside IT/CS directly supports Suffolk’s applied, interdisciplinary approach.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-tagged elective concept is scalable.</strong> The idea of letting any faculty member apply to have a course AI-tagged—with a committee reviewing applications—creates a low-friction way to grow the curriculum organically over time.</li>
            <li><strong>The experiential learning emphasis is right.</strong> Internships, capstone projects, and portfolio development are exactly what employers want to see.</li>
            <li><strong>The downtown Boston location advantage is real.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Existing course inventory is a strong foundation.</strong> Appendix B shows that we already have a meaningful set of courses across ISOM, Marketing, CompSci, and other departments that could be tagged immediately, reducing the cold-start problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions and Concerns</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Integration with the SAIL Framework</h3>
        <p>This is probably my biggest question. The SAIL Collaborative has spent two years building an institutional framework for AI literacy that won the 2025 Eduventures Innovation Award and was featured in AACSB Insights. We’ve been running faculty development workshops, designing AI-enabled assignments, launching Prompt AIChemy competitions, and developing the BEAM kiosk concept—all toward the goal of embedding AI fluency across the curriculum. The proposal doesn’t reference any of this existing infrastructure. I’m not raising this as a turf concern—I’m raising it because SAIL provides a ready-made faculty development pipeline, pedagogical framework, and institutional credibility that could dramatically strengthen this proposal. The question is: how does the co-major build on SAIL rather than run parallel to it?</p>

        <h3>2. Curriculum Balance: Applied vs. Ethics/Policy</h3>
        <p>Of the five required courses, two are focused on ethics/regulation (AI Regulatory Frameworks and Ethics, Policy & Society with AI). That’s 40% of the core devoted to policy and ethics. These topics absolutely matter, but for a program called “Applied” AI, I’d expect the center of gravity to be more hands-on. Students should be building things—training models, deploying workflows, evaluating tools in context. A single, well-designed course could cover both the ethical and regulatory dimensions. The freed-up slot could be used for a hands-on “AI Tools & Workflows” course where students actually build with AI agents, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, and automation—the exact skills that differentiate applied graduates.</p>

        <h3>3. The “Foundations of AI” Course Needs Sharper Definition</h3>
        <p>The proposal says this requirement can be met by existing CS or ISOM courses, or by a “new interdisciplinary course for CAS students who will not meet the pre-requisites.” This creates a two-tier entry point where students in the same co-major may have very different foundational preparation. What are the learning outcomes that every student must achieve, regardless of which course they take? We need a common floor. I’d recommend defining explicit competencies (e.g., can explain how a language model works, can evaluate model outputs for bias, can design a basic AI workflow) and then certifying which courses meet that bar.</p>

        <h3>4. Credit Load and Interaction with Business Core</h3>
        <p>The co-major weighs in at 22–26 credits. For SBS students who are already navigating a 56-credit business core (which we’re currently working to reduce to 47), this is a significant addition. How does this interact with the existing major requirements and the 120-credit degree? Can double-counting be applied more broadly—for instance, ISOM 201 already satisfies the business core and could count toward the co-major? The proposal mentions the internship can double-count, which is good, but we should map out the full picture for students in different majors to ensure this is genuinely feasible within four years without overloading schedules.</p>

        <h3>5. Faculty Capacity and Development</h3>
        <p>Who teaches these courses? The proposal assumes faculty will volunteer to AI-tag their courses but doesn’t address the training and support needed to do this well. This is exactly what the SAIL Friday workshops are designed for, and we’ve learned that faculty need structured support—not just encouragement—to meaningfully integrate AI. The proposal should include a faculty development plan, possibly leveraging the existing SAIL workshop infrastructure, and should identify which departments will teach the core required courses.</p>

        <h3>6. Financial Model Assumptions</h3>
        <p>The revenue projections assume 3 net-new students in Year 2 and 5 in Year 3, generating $281K and $543K net respectively. I’d like to see the underlying assumptions: what tuition rate, what retention assumptions, what’s the cost basis? More importantly, are we counting only net-new enrollments attracted by the co-major, or are we also accounting for existing students who adopt it? The distinction matters for whether this is truly incremental revenue or reallocation.</p>

        <h3>7. Governance: The PILOT Committee</h3>
        <p>The proposal references a “small PILOT committee” that reviews and approves AI-tagged course applications. Who sits on this committee? What are the criteria for approval? How often does it meet? This is a critical governance question because the quality and coherence of the co-major will depend entirely on how rigorously courses are vetted. Without clear standards, we risk “AI-washing”—courses with superficial AI content getting tagged for enrollment reasons.</p>

        <h3>8. Missing: Program-Level Learning Outcomes and Assessment</h3>
        <p>The proposal doesn’t include formal Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) or an assessment plan. For accreditation purposes—especially with AACSB and NECHE—this will need to be addressed. What should graduates of this co-major be able to do that they couldn’t do with just their primary major? Defining this clearly will also help guide course design and the AI-tagging criteria.</p>

        <h2>Concrete Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anchor the proposal in SAIL.</strong> Position the co-major as the curricular expression of the SAIL Framework. This gives it institutional legitimacy, a faculty development pipeline, and connects it to an award-winning initiative that’s already been published in AACSB Insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Consolidate ethics/policy into one course; add a hands-on AI tools course.</strong> This shifts the balance toward “applied” while still covering the ethical/regulatory ground. The tools course could cover prompt engineering, RAG, agents, workflow automation, and human-in-the-loop design—skills that are directly marketable.</li>
            <li><strong>Define common foundational competencies.</strong> Rather than pointing to different courses, define the skill floor every student must meet and certify multiple pathways to get there.</li>
            <li><strong>Map credit overlaps for top 5 majors.</strong> Show concrete four-year plans for students in Finance, Marketing, Computer Science, Political Science, and Biology pairing with the co-major. This will either validate feasibility or reveal where adjustments are needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Add SLOs and an assessment rubric.</strong> This will be required for accreditation anyway, and it will sharpen the proposal’s academic rigor.</li>
            <li><strong>Define the AI-tag criteria explicitly.</strong> What percentage of course content must involve AI? What types of assignments qualify? This prevents dilution and maintains program integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>This proposal has the right instincts. The co-major model, the market positioning, and the experiential emphasis are all sound. The main work ahead is in sharpening the curriculum’s applied core, integrating with existing institutional infrastructure (particularly SAIL), addressing feasibility questions around credits and faculty capacity, and adding the formal learning outcomes and governance structures that will be needed for approval. I’m very willing to collaborate on refining this—this is directly in the wheelhouse of what our department has been building. Happy to set up time with Jodi and Kaushik to work through the details together.</p>
